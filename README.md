The basic gist of this project is to make a travel buddy who would recommend places and activities to do in said places based on your user profile. The user profile takes into account the users personality, budget constraints, activeness, interests and address.

- The machine learning model would first generate a user profile (currently thinking of using spotify or hardcover api to understand user behaviour).
- Based on this profile a wide array of places would be recommended.
- The user would then choose which place they are interested in doing.
- Then a list of activities that are available in the destination they chose would appear.
- This list would have activities that match their user profile but also include must-do activities of each region.
- Now given the choice, the user can decide what activities they wish to do during their trip.
- After the selection of activities, accomodation suggestions will be given taking into account the number of days of travel, activity location etc.
- After these details are straightened out, then the final itinerary will be generated that is personal to the user.
